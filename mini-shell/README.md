# Mini-Shell
This very project is made with the sole purpose of learning how some parts of windows.h or directly C development work. I know I should have a parser but I just
won't right now. Blame me for the string lowering (not so hard cuz I did it myself I think), and for the ShellExecute Commands.

I think that for this small project, a code parser shouldn't be a necessity nor a priority. If anyone finds this useful I'd love any feedback at this mail: xdeveloping@outlook.com
